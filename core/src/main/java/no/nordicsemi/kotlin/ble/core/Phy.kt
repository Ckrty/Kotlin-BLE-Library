/**
 * At the bottom of the Bluetooth LE stack is the physical layer (PHY).
 * PHY refers to the physical layer radio specifications that govern the operation of the
 * Bluetooth LE radio. This layer defines different modulation and coding schemes adopted by
 * Bluetooth LE radio transmitters that affect things like the throughput of the radio.
 * This in turn changes the battery consumption of the device or the range of the connection.
 *
 * ### 1M PHY
 * 1M PHY, or 1 Megabit PHY, is the classic PHY supported by all Bluetooth LE devices.
 * As its name implies, 1M PHY uses 1 megabit per second.
 *
 * When initiating a connection between two Bluetooth LE devices, this is the mode that will be used,
 * to begin with. Then the peers can request another mode if both devices support it.
 *
 * ### 2M PHY
 * 2 Megabit PHY is a new mode introduced in Bluetooth v5.0. As the name implies, it effectively
 * doubles the data rate to 2 megabit per second, or 2 Mbps. Since the data is transmitted at a
 * higher data rate (faster), the radio needs to stay on for less time, decreasing battery usage.
 * The downside is the decrease in receiver sensitivity which translates to less communication range.
 *
 * ### Coded PHY
 * While 2M PHY exists for users willing to sacrifice range for increased data rate, coded PHY
 * was introduced to serve applications where users can achieve longer communication range by
 * sacrificing data rate. Coded PHY uses coding schemes to correct packet errors more effectively,
 * which also means that a single bit is represented by more than 1 symbol. Coded PHY uses 2 modes,
 * S=2 and S=8. In the S=2 mode, 2 symbols represent 1 bit, therefore the data rate is 500 kbps.
 * While in the S=8 mode, 8 symbols are used to represent a bit and the data rate becomes 125 kbps.
